# react-expenses-manager

This is a nice project, built with React Vite, as an exercise from a React Course that I'm following at this moment.

You can check the project finished here: https://expenses-planner-react-exercise.netlify.app/

These are some features of this project:

- Construction and reuse of components.
- Show messages on validation.
- Show/Hide a modal window, including animation.
- Creation of helpers functions.
- Using a library to add Swipe Effect (react-swipeable-list).
- Using a library to add a Pie Chart Graph (react-circular-progressbar).
- Add variables to LocalStorage so the data is not lost on browser refresh.
- Reseting the app using a button.

Please, feel free to contact me for further details!
